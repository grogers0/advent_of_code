A repository of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in Rust.

To run the code for a day, cd to `<year>/<day>` and `cargo run --release < input`. For most days,
the first line is the solution to part 1, and the second line is the solution to part 2.

To use the start\_day script, save a cookies.txt file with a single line like this:
